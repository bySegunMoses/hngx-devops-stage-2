#Project: Full Stack Web Application with Docker, NGINX, and NGINX Proxy Manager


Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a full-stack web application using Docker, including a PostgreSQL database, a backend application, and a frontend application. We have also integrated NGINX as a reverse proxy and NGINX Proxy Manager to manage SSL certificates and simplify the handling of multiple services.

#Project Structure#
The project consists of the following main components:

PostgreSQL: A relational database for persistent data storage.
Backend: The server-side application, typically a REST API.
Frontend: The client-side application, usually built with a modern framework.
NGINX: A web server used as a reverse proxy for handling requests and serving static files.
NGINX Proxy Manager: A tool for managing SSL certificates and configuring reverse proxy settings through a user-friendly interface.
Adminer: A web-based database management tool for PostgreSQL.
Docker Compose Configuration
Hereâ€™s an overview of the Docker Compose file and the rationale behind the configurations.

Services
Postgres

Image: postgres:13
Environment Variables: Set up database name, user, and password.
Volumes: Data is persisted in a Docker volume to ensure database data is not lost upon container restarts.
Ports: Exposes port 5432 to interact with the database externally.
Backend

Build: Specifies the backend directory for building the Docker image.
Volumes: Mounts the backend directory to the container, allowing live changes during development.
Ports: Exposes port 8000 for accessing the backend API.
Depends On: Ensures the PostgreSQL service is started before the backend.
Environment Variables: Sets up configuration details such as database connection and CORS settings.
Frontend

Build: Specifies the frontend directory for building the Docker image.
Command: Runs the frontend application using npm run dev for development purposes.
Volumes: Mounts the frontend directory to the container.
Ports: Exposes port 5173 for accessing the frontend application.
NGINX

Image: Uses the latest NGINX image.
Volumes: Mounts the custom NGINX configuration file.
Depends On: Ensures that both frontend and backend services are started before NGINX.
Adminer

Image: Uses the latest Adminer image for database management.
Restart Policy: Always restart to ensure high availability.
Ports: Exposes port 8080 for accessing Adminer.
Environment Variables: Sets the default database server for Adminer.
Proxy Manager

Image: Uses the latest NGINX Proxy Manager image.
Restart Policy: Configured to restart unless manually stopped.
Ports: Exposes ports 81, 80, and 443 for accessing the NGINX Proxy Manager dashboard and handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
Volumes: Mounts directories for proxy configuration and SSL certificates.
Depends On: Ensures NGINX and Adminer services are started before NGINX Proxy Manager.
Volumes
postgres_data: Ensures that PostgreSQL data is stored persistently.
The decision to Use NGINX and NGINX, Proxy Manager
NGINX
Reverse Proxy: NGINX is a reverse proxy, routing requests to the appropriate service (frontend, backend) based on URL patterns. This setup improves security and allows for better load balancing.
Static File Serving: NGINX efficiently serves static files, reducing the load on the backend and improving response times.
SSL Termination: NGINX handles SSL termination, meaning it can manage HTTPS requests and forward them as HTTP to the backend services.
NGINX Proxy Manager
User-Friendly Interface: NGINX Proxy Manager provides a web-based interface for configuring proxy settings, managing domains, and obtaining SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt, making it easier to manage complex configurations without editing config files directly.
SSL Management: The Proxy Manager simplifies obtaining and renewing SSL certificates, ensuring secure connections for the web application.
Access Control: It allows for easy setup of access controls and redirections, adding layer of security and flexibility to the application.
How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Build and Run Docker Containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Access the Applications:

Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:8000
Adminer: http://localhost:8080
Nginx Proxy Manager: http://localhost:81
Configure Domains and SSL in NGINX Proxy Manager:

Log in using the default credentials (admin@example.com / changeme).
Add your domains and configure SSL as needed.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a robust setup for a full-stack web application using Docker, NGINX, and NGINX Proxy Manager. The configuration ensures scalability, security, and ease of management, making it suitable for both development and production environments.
